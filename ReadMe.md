# MIDS Capstone Project: Grid Connection Feasibility Tool

## Introduction

This tool is designed to assist in assessing the feasibility of connecting new energy generators to the existing grid infrastructure. It targets applicants seeking to integrate their generation systems into the grid, providing a straightforward way to determine if a proposed connection is viable and, if not, how much energy storage would be necessary for the integration.

## Key Features

- Feasibility Assessment: Applicants can enter the details of the station or transmission line they wish to connect to, along with their proposed megawatt (MW) output. The tool then evaluates whether the existing grid infrastructure can handle this new output.

- Storage Requirement Calculation: In cases where the current infrastructure is insufficient for the proposed output, the tool estimates the amount of additional energy storage required to facilitate the connection.

- Integration with CAISO Data: Utilizes hourly transmission capacity data from CAISO OAISIS (under 'Transmission > Market Available Transmission Capacity') to provide up-to-date information on grid capabilities.

- Interactive Grid Map: Includes a map showing the connections between different stations and the existing CAISO queue, aiding in visualizing potential connection points and planning.

## Data Sources

- Hourly transmission capacity data from CAISO OAISIS.

- A comprehensive map detailing the connections between various stations and the existing CAISO queue.
